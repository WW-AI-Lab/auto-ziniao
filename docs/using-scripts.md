# Using scripts in skills

> How to run commands and bundle executable scripts in your skills.

Skills can instruct agents to run shell commands and bundle reusable scripts in a `scripts/` directory. This guide covers one-off commands, self-contained scripts with their own dependencies, and how to design script interfaces for agentic use.

## One-off commands

When an existing package already does what you need, you can reference it directly in your `SKILL.md` instructions without a `scripts/` directory.

Common runtime tools:
- **uvx** (Python): `uvx ruff@0.8.0 check .`
- **npx** (Node.js): `npx eslint@9 --fix .`
- **bunx** (Bun): `bunx eslint@9 --fix .`
- **go run** (Go): `go run golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@v0.28.0 .`

**Tips for one-off commands in skills:**

* **Pin versions** (e.g., `npx eslint@9.0.0`) so the command behaves the same over time.
* **State prerequisites** in your `SKILL.md` (e.g., "Requires Node.js 18+") rather than assuming the agent's environment has them.
* **Move complex commands into scripts.** A one-off command works well when you're invoking a tool with a few flags. When a command grows complex enough that it's hard to get right on the first try, a tested script in `scripts/` is more reliable.

## Referencing scripts from `SKILL.md`

Use **relative paths from the skill directory root** to reference bundled files. The agent resolves these paths automatically — no absolute paths needed.

List available scripts in your `SKILL.md` so the agent knows they exist:

```markdown
## Available scripts

- **`scripts/validate.sh`** — Validates configuration files
- **`scripts/process.py`** — Processes input data
```

Then instruct the agent to run them:

```markdown
## Workflow

1. Run the validation script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/validate.sh "$INPUT_FILE"
   ```

2. Process the results:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/process.py --input results.json
   ```
```

## Self-contained scripts

When you need reusable logic, bundle a script in `scripts/` that declares its own dependencies inline.

### Python (PEP 723)

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "beautifulsoup4",
# ]
# ///

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html = '<html><body><h1>Welcome</h1><p class="info">This is a test.</p></body></html>'
print(BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser").select_one("p.info").get_text())
```

Run with: `uv run scripts/extract.py`

## Designing scripts for agentic use

When an agent runs your script, it reads stdout and stderr to decide what to do next. A few design choices make scripts dramatically easier for agents to use.

### Avoid interactive prompts

This is a hard requirement of the agent execution environment. Agents operate in non-interactive shells — they cannot respond to TTY prompts, password dialogs, or confirmation menus. A script that blocks on interactive input will hang indefinitely.

Accept all input via command-line flags, environment variables, or stdin:

```
# Bad: hangs waiting for input
$ python scripts/deploy.py
Target environment: _

# Good: clear error with guidance
$ python scripts/deploy.py
Error: --env is required. Options: development, staging, production.
Usage: python scripts/deploy.py --env staging --tag v1.2.3
```

### Document usage with `--help`

`--help` output is the primary way an agent learns your script's interface. Include a brief description, available flags, and usage examples.

### Write helpful error messages

When an agent gets an error, the message directly shapes its next attempt. An opaque "Error: invalid input" wastes a turn. Instead, say what went wrong, what was expected, and what to try:

```
Error: --format must be one of: json, csv, table.
       Received: "xml"
```

### Use structured output

Prefer structured formats — JSON, CSV, TSV — over free-form text. Structured formats can be consumed by both the agent and standard tools (`jq`, `cut`, `awk`), making your script composable in pipelines.

**Separate data from diagnostics:** send structured data to stdout and progress messages, warnings, and other diagnostics to stderr.

### Further considerations

* **Idempotency.** Agents may retry commands. "Create if not exists" is safer than "create and fail on duplicate."
* **Input constraints.** Reject ambiguous input with a clear error rather than guessing. Use enums and closed sets where possible.
* **Dry-run support.** For destructive or stateful operations, a `--dry-run` flag lets the agent preview what will happen.
* **Meaningful exit codes.** Use distinct exit codes for different failure types and document them in your `--help` output.
* **Safe defaults.** Consider whether destructive operations should require explicit confirmation flags.
* **Predictable output size.** Default to a summary or a reasonable limit, and support flags like `--offset` so the agent can request more information when needed.
